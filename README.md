ModelPort is a self-hosted LLM gateway for Anthropic-compatible and
OpenAI-compatible clients. It gives Claude Code, SDKs, and internal
applications one endpoint for authentication, model routing, quotas, usage,
Provider health, request evidence, and operations.

## What You Get

- `POST /v1/messages`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `GET /v1/models`, and
  opt-in exact token counting.
- Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible Provider adapters with bounded streaming and
  Tool Use conversion.
- Optional CPA Codex and Claude account channels that remain internal Providers
  behind ModelPort's policy, routing, and evidence boundary.
- Deterministic routes plus opt-in explainable smart routing with shadow mode,
  stable canaries, and durable decision evidence.
- Scoped client API keys, users, teams, quotas, spend controls, Provider
  credential pools, cooldown, and bounded fallback.
- A React operations dashboard and a PostgreSQL request, usage, budget, and
  audit ledger.
- Docker Compose and systemd deployment paths, backup/restore tooling,
  Prometheus metrics, and acceptance scripts.

ModelPort currently supports one trusted host or a small trusted network. It is
not a public multi-tenant service, model runtime, chat UI, payment processor, or
Provider invoice. See [Production](docs/PRODUCTION.md) and
[Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) before making broader availability claims.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Git, Docker, Docker Compose v2, and credentials for at least one
Provider. The maintained example uses DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible endpoint.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tiammomo/ModelPort.git
cd ModelPort
cp deploy/docker/modelport.env.example .env
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

Edit `.env` and replace every required `replace-with-...` value. At minimum set
unique router, administrator, PostgreSQL, and Provider credentials. Keep
`MODELPORT_AUTH_TOKEN` and the client-side `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` equal for the
first local test.

```bash
scripts/build-container.sh
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:33002` and sign in with
`MODELPORT_ADMIN_USERNAME`/`MODELPORT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

For local Qwen, another Provider, production hardening, or troubleshooting,
follow the tested [Getting Started guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Send Your First Request

```bash
source .env

curl -fsS \
  -H "x-api-key: $MODELPORT_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  http://127.0.0.1:38082/v1/messages \
  -d '{
    "model":"deepseek-v4-flash",
    "max_tokens":96,
    "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply exactly: OK"}]
  }'
```

This call can consume Provider quota. `scripts/smoke-test.sh` is local-only;
use `scripts/smoke-test.sh --upstream` when a paid synthetic call is intended.

Claude Code:

```env
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:38082
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<MODELPORT_AUTH_TOKEN>
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
```

OpenAI-compatible SDK:

```env
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:38082/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=<MODELPORT_CLIENT_KEY>
OPENAI_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
```

Use a dashboard-issued scoped client key for shared deployments. Provider keys
stay in ModelPort and must never be copied into client applications.

  request, and common startup failures.

- [Providers](docs/PROVIDERS.md) — hosted Providers, local runtimes, and
  compatibility evidence.

  rollback.
- [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) — Docker Compose, systemd, and production
  topology.

- [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) — contributor workflow and test matrix.
- [Documentation index](docs/README.md) — role-based navigation.

## Security And Support

Keep backend and PostgreSQL ports private. Use same-origin HTTPS, exact trusted
proxy CIDRs, secure cookies, CSRF protection, and dashboard-issued API keys for
shared use. Never commit `.env`, Provider keys, backups, prompts, responses, or
raw sensitive logs.

Read [Security](SECURITY.md), [Privacy](PRIVACY.md), [Support](SUPPORT.md), and
[Governance](GOVERNANCE.md). Community support has no SLA unless a separate
written agreement provides one.

## Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp config.example.toml config.toml
# replace required placeholders
scripts/start.sh

cd dashboard
npm ci
npm run dev
```
